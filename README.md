# RaspberryPi GPIO Fun Projects

Here is a (hopefully growing) collection of scripts and such meant to control electronics through a RaspberryPi.

These projects assume that you have the knowledge, skills and resources (and the pi itself) needed to build the required electronic circuitry to interact with the code. Most (if not all) of these projects make use of the python library gpiozero for interfacing with a RaspberryPi's GPIO system, so it should be relatively easy to do stuff with your electronic parts.

If you are not sure how to make the required circuitry, then simply go to the FreeNove RaspberryPi repository [here](https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_Ultimate_Starter_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi) and check out the parts list and the tutorials for building what is needed for a particular project. Also, check out gpiozero's [documentation](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for additional help with components and parts.

## About
This was just a fun thing to do over the holidays. I learned a lot about physical computing and electronics thanks to the RaspberryPi and gpiozero. What was great was being able to make unique and original electronics projects, rather than just making projects straight from tutorials. You should try to make your own projects and see how awesome (and maybe even useful) they can be!
